# Cap and Skull Frozen Flask App

This is the (in-progress) Cap & Skull website built with Python & Flask because Sakib hates JavaScript.

## Setup

After going into the directory, these are the steps to get the app up and running locally:

```
$ python3 -m venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r pip.req
```

#### Step 2. Run the Server

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
$ ./run.py
```
